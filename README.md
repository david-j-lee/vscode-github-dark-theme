# Github Dark Color Theme

A Github inspired dark color theme for VS Code.

The initial color scheme is based off of the
[offical theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme).
Updates have been made to try and follow the color schema used on the Github
website.
